            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Our platform is a self-hosted code execution system that runs on your Kubernetes infrastructure. Easily spin up sandboxes, execute code safely, and integrate with your applications. Full Docker compatibility, language-agnostic execution, and enterprise security. And since you deploy it yourself on your own infrastructure, you control your data, your costs, and your compliance.</p>

            <h3>But executing arbitrary code is risky</h3>
            <p>Exactly. Running untrusted code can compromise your servers, steal data, or crash your applications. Most teams either avoid the problem entirely or cobble together unsafe solutions with Docker and crossed fingers. That's why we built a platform specifically for safe code execution - complete isolation, resource limits, and security policies that actually work.</p>
            <p>Companies are already using our platform to safely execute user code, AI-generated scripts, and automated workflows without the security nightmares.</p>
