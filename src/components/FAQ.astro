      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <br />
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Just $997 per year, self-hosted, really? No per-execution fees?</h4>
          <p>Yes, our platform is $997 per year per cluster deployment, not per execution or per user. No surprise bills, no usage limits, no data egress fees. You deploy it, you own the compute costs. Like buying a database instead of renting one.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Does each developer have to install anything?</h4>
          <p>Nope — one person (you, your DevOps team, etc.) deploys it to your Kubernetes cluster using our CLI or Helm charts. Once it's running, developers integrate via our REST API, SDKs, or existing tools. No client-side installation required.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How do updates work? Do they cost extra?</h4>
          <p>Each deployment can check for updates automatically via Helm or you can manage updates manually. Minor version updates (like from 1.0 to 1.1) are included. Major version upgrades may require a new license. You control when and how to upgrade.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What languages and runtimes are supported?</h4>
          <p>All of them. Our platform uses Docker containers, so any language or runtime that can run in Docker can run in our sandboxes. We provide pre-built images for popular languages and you can bring your own custom images.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Is monitoring and observability included?</h4>
          <p>Our platform integrates seamlessly with your existing monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, etc.). We expose standard metrics and logs through your cluster's monitoring setup - no separate dashboards to learn or vendor lock-in for observability. Your monitoring tools, your data.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>WCan we run this in air-gapped environments?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. Since everything runs on your infrastructure, our platform works perfectly in air-gapped networks without internet access. Excellent for regulated industries, government, or high-security environments.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How does security and isolation work?</h4>
          <p>Each sandbox runs in its own container with configurable resource limits, network policies, and filesystem isolation. Full support for Pod Security Standards, network segmentation, and integration with your existing security tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Can we customize the execution environment?</h4>
          <p>Yes! You get full control over the base images, installed packages, environment variables, and resource limits. Build your own images or extend our pre-built ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What about compliance and data residency?</h4>
          <p>Since everything runs on your infrastructure, you maintain complete control over data location, retention, and compliance requirements. GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 — whatever you need, you control.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Can we integrate with our existing CI/CD pipeline?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. REST API, webhooks, and pre-built integrations for popular CI/CD tools. Use it as a step in your pipeline or as a backend for your development tools.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What if we need support or have issues?</h4>
          <p>Email support is included with annual licenses. That means help with deployment, configuration, scaling, and troubleshooting. We'll help you succeed, but we can't manage your Kubernetes cluster for you.</p>
