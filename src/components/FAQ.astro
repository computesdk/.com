      <h2>Pricing & Usage</h2>
      <br />
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>What does it cost?</h4>
          <p>$97/month includes 100,000 executions. Additional executions are $97 per 100k. An "execution" is any API call - file operation, terminal command, or signal.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What counts as an execution?</h4>
          <p>Every API call counts as one execution: creating a file, running a terminal command, sending a signal, or getting file status. WebSocket connections themselves don't count, only the operations you perform.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Can we use this across multiple environments?</h4>
          <p>Your subscription covers usage across all your compute environments - whether that's staging and production, or multiple providers like Vercel and Fly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How does team usage work?</h4>
          <p>The pricing is per organization, not per user. Your whole team can use Sidekick across all your environments, sharing the execution allowance.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How do API keys work?</h4>
          <p>You'll get an API key when you sign up. Set it as an environment variable in your compute environment, and Sidekick will automatically track your usage and apply it to your account. One API key works across all your environments and providers.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What about SSH and VS Code for Web?</h4>
          <p>SSH access and VS Code for Web are coming soon as optional add-ons. These will be opt-in features since they require additional resources, but they'll integrate seamlessly with the existing API.</p>
