  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>Inside your compute environment (Vercel, Fly, etc.) <code>$ sidekick launch</code></p> 
  <p>Returns a WebSocket endpoint for real-time connection. <code>wss://your-environment.com/ws</code></p>
  <p>Now you have full development access:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time file operations</li>
    <li>Interactive terminal sessions</li>
    <li>Live file watching</li>
    <li>Signal broadcasting</li>
  </ul>
<h3>It works everywhere you need it</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Production debugging.</strong> Something broken in production? Launch Sidekick and debug directly in the live environment with full file access and terminal control.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-provider development.</strong> Working across Vercel, Fly, and Cloudflare? Same development experience everywhere, no context switching.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud-native development.</strong> Skip the "works on my machine" problem entirely. Develop where your code actually runs.</li>
    <li><strong>Team standardization.</strong> Give your entire team the same powerful development interface, regardless of which compute provider they prefer.</li>
    <li><strong>CI/CD integration.</strong> Build development and debugging capabilities directly into your deployment pipeline.</li>
    <li><strong>Live collaboration.</strong> Multiple developers can connect to the same environment simultaneously for pair programming or debugging sessions.</li>
  </ul>
