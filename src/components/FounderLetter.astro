      <p class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-emerald-800/70 dark:text-emerald-200/70">Introducing</p>
      <h1 class="mt-2 text-pretty text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white sm:text-5xl">All of a sudden everyone is a coder now.</h1>
      <p class="mt-6 text-xl/8">I remember scouring through the Joomla! documentation site for a website I was building when I was 13. I remember that the concepts were not the gotchas, but syntax or one little piece of information was. Every bit of detail was worth reading because you weren't sure when you would need it for recall.</p>
      <div class="mt-10 max-w-2xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        <p>On June 20, 2024 anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet and the internet changed. All of a sudden an AI studio had released a model that was good enough to output code for all of us. All of a sudden everyone could be a coder. A vibe coder.</p>
        <p>However, just like any experienced programmer can tell you. Creating something is addicting. The next million developers haven't learned to code by building Joomla, WordPress or Magento sites like me. They've learned or are learning to code by vibe coding.</p>
        <p class="mt-6 text-xl/8 font-bold">Simplicity is more important than ever.</p>
        <p>These next sets of coders don't want to fiddle with Terraform, CDK, or some vendor's docs. They don't even want to waste context window space on this. The next set of coders want to build even more complex applications and therefore need to simplify. They don't want to be forced to make "The Right Decision". They want optionality in their compute layer.</p>
        <p>ComputeSDK is a primitive to help you build any application. To start, we're building the primitive around raw compute. We've aggregated some of the best integrations from E2B, Vercel, Fly, and Cloudflare so that you can get started quickly without needing to manage the complexity of a specific vendor.</p>
        <p>We can't wait to see what you build.</p>
