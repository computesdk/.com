        <p>All of a sudden everyone is a coder now.</p>
        <p>
          I remember scouring through the Joomla! documentation site for a
          website I was building when I was 13. I remember that the concepts
          were not the gotchas, but syntax or one little piece of information
          was. Every bit of detail was worth reading because you weren't sure
          when you would need it for recall.
        </p>

        <p>
          On June 20, 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet and the
          internet changed. All of a sudden an AI studio had released a model
          that was good enough to output code for all of us. Everyone could be a
          coder. A vibe coder.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, just like any experienced programmer can tell you, creating
          something is addicting. The next million developers haven't learned to
          code by building Joomla, WordPress, or Magento sites like me. They've
          learned—or are learning—to code by vibe coding.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold">Simplicity is more important than ever.</p>

        <p>
          These next generations of coders don't want to fiddle with Terraform,
          CDK, or some vendor's docs. They don't even want to waste context
          window space on this. The next set of coders want to build even more
          complex applications and therefore need to simplify. They don't want
          to be forced to make "The Right Decision." They want optionality in
          their compute layer.
        </p>

        <p>
          ComputeSDK is a primitive to help you build any application. To start,
          we're building the primitive around raw compute. We've aggregated some
          of the best integrations from E2B, Vercel, Fly, and Cloudflare so that
          you can get started quickly without needing to manage the complexity
          of a specific vendor.
        </p>

        <p>We can't wait to see what you build.</p>
