### ComputeSDK Vercel Provider Documentation
This guide provides detailed information on how to install, configure, and use the Vercel provider within ComputeSDK. The Vercel provider allows you to execute code in secure, isolated sandboxed environments on Vercel's infrastructure, all while maintaining the consistent ComputeSDK interface.

#### Overview
The @computesdk/vercel package integrates ComputeSDK with Vercel's serverless functions, allowing you to leverage Vercel's platform for sandboxed code execution. This is particularly useful for projects already deployed on Vercel or those that benefit from Vercel's ecosystem.

#### Installation
To use the Vercel provider, you need to install its dedicated package in addition to the core ComputeSDK.

```bash
npm install @computesdk/vercel
```

If you haven't already, also install the core SDK:

```bash
npm install computesdk
```

#### Provider Setup
To authenticate with Vercel, you must set your Vercel API token, team ID, and project ID as environment variables. ComputeSDK's Vercel provider will automatically pick these up.

```bash
export VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
export VERCEL_TEAM_ID=your_vercel_team_id
export VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id
```

VERCEL_TOKEN: Your personal Vercel API token. You can generate one from your Vercel account settings.

VERCEL_TEAM_ID: The ID of the Vercel team associated with your project. This is found in your Vercel dashboard URL (e.g., vercel.com/<team_id>/<project_id>).

VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: The ID of the Vercel project where your sandbox functions will be deployed. This is also found in your Vercel dashboard URL.

#### Usage
You can use the Vercel provider either through ComputeSDK's auto-detection mechanism (if Vercel environment variables are set and Vercel is the first available provider) or by explicitly initializing it.

#### Explicit Initialization
To explicitly use the Vercel provider, import vercel from @computesdk/vercel:

```typescript
import { vercel } from '@computesdk/vercel';

const sandbox = vercel({
  runtime: 'node',    // 'node' or 'python', defaults to 'node'
  timeout: 300000,    // optional, defaults to 5 minutes (300 seconds)
});

// Now you can execute code and perform filesystem operations
const result = await sandbox.execute('console.log("Hello from Vercel!")');
console.log(result.stdout);

await sandbox.kill();
```

runtime: (Optional) Specifies the runtime environment for the Vercel function. Can be 'node' or 'python'. Defaults to 'node'.

timeout: (Optional) Sets the maximum execution time for the Vercel function in milliseconds. Defaults to 5 minutes (300,000 ms).

#### Examples
Here are some practical examples demonstrating the use of the Vercel provider for code execution and filesystem operations.

#### Executing Node.js Code on Vercel
This example shows how to execute a simple Node.js script within the Vercel sandbox and retrieve its output.

```typescript
import { vercel } from '@computesdk/vercel';

const sandbox = vercel({ runtime: 'node' }); // Initialize Vercel sandbox with Node.js runtime

const result = await sandbox.execute(`
console.log('Node.js version:', process.version);
console.log('Hello from Vercel Sandbox!');
`);
console.log(result.stdout);

await sandbox.kill();

Executing Python Code on Vercel
This example demonstrates executing a Python script within the Vercel sandbox.

import { vercel } from '@computesdk/vercel';

const sandbox = vercel({ runtime: 'python' }); // Initialize Vercel sandbox with Python runtime

const result = await sandbox.execute(`
import sys
print('Hello from Vercel Sandbox (Python)!')
print(f'Python version: {sys.version}')
`);
console.log(result.stdout);

await sandbox.kill();
```

#### Filesystem Operations with Vercel
The sandbox.filesystem interface works identically across all providers, including Vercel. This example shows basic file operations.

```typescript
import { vercel } from '@computesdk/vercel';

const sandbox = vercel(); // Initialize Vercel sandbox

// Create a directory
await sandbox.filesystem.mkdir('/tmp/my-vercel-data');

// Write content to a file
const filePath = '/tmp/my-vercel-data/report.txt';
await sandbox.filesystem.writeFile(filePath, 'This is a report generated by Vercel sandbox.');
console.log(`File written to ${filePath}`);

// Read content from the file
const content = await sandbox.filesystem.readFile(filePath);
console.log('Content read:', content);

// List directory contents
const entries = await sandbox.filesystem.readdir('/tmp/my-vercel-data');
console.log('Directory entries:', entries.map(e => e.name));

// Remove the file
await sandbox.filesystem.remove(filePath);
console.log(`File removed: ${filePath}`);

await sandbox.kill();
```
