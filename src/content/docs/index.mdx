<p>All of a sudden everyone is a coder now.</p>

<p>
          I remember scouring through the Joomla! docs for a site I was building
          when I was 13. I remember that the concepts were not the gotchas, but
          syntax or one little piece of information was. Every bit of detail was
          worth reading because you weren't sure when you would need it for
          recall.
        </p>

<p>
          On June 20, 2024 anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet and the internet
          changed. All of a sudden an AI studio had released a model that was
          good enough to output code. All of a sudden everyone could be a coder.
          A vibe coder.
        </p>

<p>
          However, just like any experienced programmer can tell you. Creating
          something is addicting. The next million developers didn't learn to
          code by building Joomla, WordPress or Magento sites like me. They've
          learned or are learning to code by vibe coding.

<p class="font-semibold">
          Compressing complexity is more important than ever.
        </p>

<p>
          These next sets of coders don't want to fiddle with Terraform, CDK, or
          some vendor's docs. The next set of coders want to build even more
          complex applications and therefore need to compress the complexity.
        </p>

<p>
		ComputeSDK is a primitive to help you build any application. To start,
          we're building the primitive around raw compute. We've aggregated some
          of the best integrations from E2B, Vercel, Fly, and Cloudflare so that
          you can get started quickly without needing to manage the complexity
          of a specific vendor.
        </p>

<p>
		 Additionally, we're rolling our own Kubernetes Operator so that anyone
          can self-host without missing out on magical experiences.
